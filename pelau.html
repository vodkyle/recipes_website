        <p class="header">Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ pounds chicken thighs, bone-in, skin on (could also use chicken legs)</li>
            <li>3 sprigs thyme, use less if using dried thyme</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, finely chopped, grated or pressed</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp Ground Black Pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or any neutral cooking oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups long grain rice, washed and drained</li>
            <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup carrot, chopped</li>
            <li>19 ounces dry pigeon peas, rinsed and drained (1 can)</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon scotch bonnet pepper, or more if desired</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cilantro, finely chopped</li>
            <li>¼ cup green onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>7 ounces coconut milk</li>
            <li>3 cups hot water, or chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Golden Ray margarine, optional</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="header">Steps</p>
        <ol>
            <li>OPTIONAL STEP: Place chicken in a large bowl to marinate. Add 1 sprig of thyme (reserve the other 3 for cooking), garlic, salt, and black pepper. Stir to coat the chicken with the seasonings, cover and place in the fridge for 30 minutes (or overnight).</li>
            <li>Add oil to a large heavy bottom pot, and place over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Once oil is hot (but not smoking) pour the sugar into the pot in an even layer and allow to caramelize.
                The sugar will melt and bubble as it caramelizes. Do not stir the sugar, but watch it carefully to look for the change in colour.
                Wait until the sugar just starts to turn dark brown in colour (not black!), then carefully add chicken to the pot and stir to coat with the "burnt" sugar.</li>
            <li>Add onion, carrots and pigeon peas to the pot and stir to combine. Cook for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add rice, stir, and cook for another 5 minutes. Then add cilantro, green onion, reserved sprigs of thyme, and scotch bonnet pepper. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Add coconut milk and hot water to the pot. Season with salt and black pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover pot and gently simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until all liquid has been absorbed and rice is cooked through.</li>
            <li>Stir in margarine, if using. Serve hot or at room temperature.</li>
        </ol>
