        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 whole chicken chopped into 8 pieces</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Green Seasoning</li>
            <li>2 drops of worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 tsp ketchup</li>
            <li>1 juice of lime</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of water</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups of italian bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups approximatley of canola/vegetable oil (amount depends on the size of frying pan)</li>
            <li>5 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>a knob of ginger</li>
            <li>2 stalks of green onions</li>
            <li>1 bunch of cilantro</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of thyme</li>
            <li>1 sprig of rosemary</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Squeeze the juice of your lime over the chicken pieces. Wash with cold water and drain.</li>
            <li>Season your chicken with the green seasoning, worcestershire sauce, ketchup, salt and black pepper. Set aside to marinate for 1 to 24 hours. The longer it marinates the better of course.</li>
            <li>In a deep bottom pot layer your chicken pieces with the dark meat at the bottom and white pieces at the top. That is drumsticks, thighs, wings, then breast meat on top. Pour in your 1/4 cup of water. Set this on the stove on very low heat or on low simmer and cover tightly. This will help our chicken to steam and release its own juices. You can turn the chicken once while it is steaming just to rotate the meat. You will steam it for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 25 minutes the meat will be at least 90 percent cooked. Which is okay as we still have to fry it.</li>
            <li>Time for frying. First we want to heat our oil to 350 degrees. You will need enough oil to cover the chicken pieces, but not over flow the put once the meat is in it.</li>
            <li>I actually have a deep fryer, so it was very easy. First crack your two eggs into a medium bowl, add 1 tsp chili powder to the eggs and mix well. In a seperate larger bowl place your italian bread crumbs. I used italian bread curmbs because I love the little flecks of parsley in it.</li>
            <li>Now time for our breading process. First dip the steamed chicken pieces one at a time into the egg batter, place in bowl with bread crumbs, make sure you get the bread crumbs all over the chicken. When oil is hot place chicken pieces into hot oil. You can fry at least 3 to 4 pieces at a time. Remember to not crowd your chicken while frying.</li>
            <li>As soon as your chicken turns a nice golden brown color, which would be 5-7 minutes remove the chicken and drain on paper towels or grease proof paper. Repeat process untill all your chicken is fried.</li>
        </ol>
